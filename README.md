# Build a Simple Guessing Game

## This challenge will help you to:
- Break down problems into implementable pseudocode
- Implement a basic Python class and identify when to use instance variables
- Use flow control and iteration where appropriate
- Explain how instance variables and methods represent the characteristics and actions of an object

## Summary

Let's create a simple guessing game. Think in terms of when you were 7 and asked your friends to identify the number you were thinking.

Your `GuessingGame` class should be initialized with an integer called `answer`.

Define an instance method `GuessingGame#guess` which takes an integer called `guess` as its input. `guess` should return the symbol `:high` if the `guess` is larger than the `answer`, `:correct` if the `guess` is equal to the `answer`, and `:low` if the `guess` is lower than the `answer`.

Define an instance method `GuessingGame#solved?` which returns `true` if the most recent `guess` was correct and `false` otherwise.

In this case, we're asking you to use symbols for `:low`, `:high`, and `:correct`. This is partly due to the way strings and symbols are stored in memory. If you're interested in more information, look it up!

For example:

```python
game = GuessingGame(10)

game.solved   # => False

game.guess(5)  # => low
game.guess(20) # => high
game.solved   # => false

game.guess(10) # => correct
game.solved   # => True
```

Or:

```python
import random

game = GuessingGame(random.randint(1,100))
last_guess  = None
last_result = None

While game.solved == False
  if last_guess not None 
    print(f"Oops! Your last guess ({last_guess}) was {last_result}.")
    print("")

  last_guess  = input("Enter your guess: ")
  last_result = game.guess(last_guess)


print(f"{last_guess} was correct!")
```
